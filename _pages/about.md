I am a current MD/PhD student split between the University of Colorado-School of Medicine and the University of Cambridge. As an applied mathematician/software engineer turned future physician, I am excited to apply my computational and mathematical background to help in the discovery of mechanisms behind inflammatory diseases of the gut. 

I am about to begin the PhD portion of my training in Biotechnology and Mathematics/Statistics where I will be working with [Dr. Roisin Owens](https://www.ceb.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/best) and [Dr. Sergio Bacallado](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sb2116/). I was recently awarded the [Gates Cambridge Scholarship](https://www.gatescambridge.org/members-area/connect/directory/scholar/17712) and [Rotary International Scholarship](https://www.rotary.org/en/our-programs/scholarships), to whom I am grateful for funding my PhD.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Uber](https://eng.uber.com) for 3 years. I also completed my MPhil at Cambridge working at the [Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/trynka-faculty/) and my BS in Applied Mathematics at [University of Colorado-Boulder](http://amath.colorado.edu/).
